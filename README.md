# Learning CSS `contain`

Just one of the things I'm learning. <https://github.com/hchiam/learning>

Simply: use `contain: content`.

Use the `contain: strict` option if you're okay with explicitly specifying a size on the element, since in exchange for the most perf improvement, the element is additionally no longer defined by the size of its children.
